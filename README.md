# Keycap
Keycap is a c# .net library, for super easy key board input. Keycap can be used in all different c# .net projects cause it uses a low level keyboard hook.

# How to implement Keycab?
Keycab is very easy to use and implement.
First you have to download and insert the Keycab library into your project.
Then make sure you have a reference to the Keycab library.
Once that is done you just have to write:
```c#
	using Keycap;
```
And in the very beginnin of you application somewhere you have to write:
```c#
	Input.initInput();
```
This function will initialize the library and register the keyboard hook.

Now Keycab is setup and ready to use.

#How to use?
Keycab knows 8 different methodes you can use.
The methodes are devided under 3 different categories:

- OnUpdateInput
- RegisteredEvents
- Remove

###### On Update Input
The OnUpdateInput methodes are meant to check if a key is pressed down/up in a certain frame. You can use it like this:
```c#
	// On pressed down
	if(Input.onKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)){
		// if the space key is pressed down
	}
	
	// On key released
	if(Input.onKeyUp(KeyCode.Space)){
		// if the space key is released
	}
	
	// On constantly pressed down
	if(Input.onKeyPressed(KeyCode.Space)){
		// if the space key is constantly pressed down
	}
```

###### Registered Events
The registered events are ment to work outside a updating enviroment.
These functions register a key event and gives a callback everytime the events occurs.
Use the registered events like this:
```c#
	// Register on key down event.
	// First parm: The key you want to target.
	// Second parm: The void you want to use as callback
	// Thirth (Optional) parm: Do you want this event to occur once or until stopped.
	Input.registerOnKeyDown(KeyCode.Space,CallbackVoid,true);
	
	// Register on key constantly pressed.
	// First parm: The key you want to target.
	// Second parm: The void you want to use as callback
	Input.registerOnKeyPressed(KeyCode.Space,CallbackVoid);
	
	// Register on key released.
	// First parm: The key you want to target.
	// Second parm: The void you want to use as callback
	// Thirth (Optional) parm: Do you want this event to occur once or until stopped.
	Input.registerOnKeyUp(KeyCode.Space,CallbackVoid,true);
```

###### Remove
If you want to remove a registered event you can just use this function:
```c#
	// remove all the registered events from a key
	Input.removeKeyRegister(KeyCode.Space);
```
